"""Doc-citation guard: fail loud when a citation stops resolving.

Comments cite docs as their authority — ``spec.md §5``, ``methods.md "Fire
lens"``. Nothing re-reads them, so a citation can rot in place while the code
still runs and every test still passes (two sweeps in the project this template
came from found exactly that).

THIS GUARD COVERS EXACTLY ONE OF THE THREE FAILURE CLASSES — the mechanical one:

  1. **The pointer stops resolving** — the doc is gone, the section number does
     not exist, or the citation names a LINE NUMBER and the doc has since grown
     (one such citation drifted ~240 lines in two months). THIS IS WHAT THE
     GUARD CHECKS, and it is fully decidable.
  2. **The same figure lives in 2+ places and they drift apart.** Not checkable
     here; the fix is to stop duplicating the figure.
  3. **The prose no longer supports the claim** — "19 rows" that are 19
     *accounts*. Requires judgement. That is what a periodic sweep is for.

⚠️ **LINE-NUMBER CITATIONS ARE BANNED OUTRIGHT**, not validated. A line number is
correct only until the doc is edited, and it fails SILENTLY and PLAUSIBLY — it
lands on some other real content rather than erroring. Cite ``§N`` or a section
title instead.

⚠️ **BOTH SPELLINGS, and the second one is the one that matters.** The first cut
of this guard required the literal word "line", so it caught "SPEC_phase1.md line ~308"
and missed "SPEC_phase1.md:207" — which is the form the terminal renders as a clickable
link, so it is what anyone actually types. Two such citations sat unflagged in
``TODO.md`` from the day this guard shipped until 2026-08-09, both pointing at a
line that had since become the *correction* of the claim citing it: plausible,
wrong, silent, exactly as the ban predicts. A guard that bans only the wordy
spelling of a mistake bans the spelling nobody uses. ``#L207`` (GitHub's) is
banned too; a bare ``#anchor`` is a real fragment and stays legal.

History files are deliberately NOT scanned: ``session-summary/`` is frozen by
definition, and ``TODO_archive.md`` / ``AUDIT_LEDGER.md`` are append-only records
that *quote* the banned form in order to document it. A citation wrapped in
quotes is likewise treated as a mention, not a use.

Outcomes (exit codes; 2 is argparse's):
  0  ok    — every citation resolves (quoted-title misses warn only).
  5  drift — a citation names a missing doc, an absent section, or a line number.
