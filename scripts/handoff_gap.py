"""What has landed since the newest handoff — the evidence a session-end nag lacks.

`CLAUDE.md` requires a written record in `session-summary/` before context is
lost, and several places say so. **The rule was never under-supplied.** What
was missing is that a hook firing the same sentence whether eight PRs had landed
or none — *"if you did substantive work, run /handoff"* — cannot distinguish a
session that owes a handoff from one that does not, and a warning that always
fires is one you learn to skim. A working guard on a channel nobody reads is
the standing failure mode this template exists to prevent, applied to its own
session ritual.

So this replaces the instruction with the measurement: **commits touching
substantive paths that landed after the newest handoff's own last commit**, plus
uncommitted work in those paths. When nothing is owed it prints NOTHING, which is
what makes the message worth reading when it appears.

⚠️ **Silence here is not "the handoff is complete", only "no code has moved since
it was last committed."** A handoff can be present and wrong, and no diff can see
that. It answers *is there unrecorded work*, not *is the record good*.

⚠️ **Fails silent, always.** It runs at session end and at session start, where
anything it prints competes with the user's own output and a traceback would be
noise at the worst moment. No git, no repo, a detached HEAD, a shallow clone with
no history for the handoff file — every one of them exits 0 saying nothing. It
can never be the reason a session ends badly.

⚠️ **THE CHANNEL IS THE HALF THAT WAS WRONG, and no test caught it.** The
first wiring emitted JSON on `SessionEnd` and `PreCompact`. Per the hooks
reference, both throw it away:

  - `SessionEnd` — *"Claude Code discards their JSON output fields, such as
    `systemMessage`."* Its one documented surface is **stderr** ("Shows stderr
    to user only"), and the hook was piping stderr to `/dev/null`.
  - `PreCompact` — *"Claude Code discards a PreCompact hook's `systemMessage`
    and `continue` fields."* `additionalContext` is not one of its fields
    (it sits in the top-level-`decision` group), and exit-0 stdout goes to the
    debug log. **Its only surface is exit 2, which BLOCKS compaction** — and on
    an auto-compact recovering from a context-limit error, blocking fails the
    request outright. A guard that swears it can never end a session badly may
    not use that. So the PreCompact hook is gone, not rewired.
  - `SessionStart` is the channel that works, and it covers what PreCompact was
    reaching for: it fires with `source: "compact"` **after** a compaction and
    `source: "clear"` **after** `/clear` — the two moments `CLAUDE.md` names —
    and its `additionalContext` is documented to reach Claude, with
    `systemMessage` shown to the user.

18 tests pinned the JSON *shape* and none asked whether anything reads it.
Pin the channel, not the shape.

Usage:
    python scripts/handoff_gap.py                  # plain text, or nothing
    python scripts/handoff_gap.py --session-start  # SessionStart hook shape
    python scripts/handoff_gap.py --session-end    # SessionEnd: stderr, no JSON
