"""One-shot: move CLOSED TODO.md items into docs/TODO_archive.md.

TODO.md is read first in every session (CLAUDE.md), and in the source project
it grew to 1,839 lines of which ~740 were CLOSED work kept in place for the
record. That record
is worth having — "never redo a closed item without asking" depends on it — but
it does not need to be re-read every session to serve that purpose.

So: closed items move to the archive VERBATIM, and each leaves a one-line entry
in TODO.md's existing `## Done` section. The no-redo rule still works by
grepping `## Done`; the reasoning is one hop away. Same shape as
`session-summary/archive/` and the one-line-plus-pointer rule for DECISIONS.md.

Verifies that no line is lost before writing anything, and REFUSES to archive a
closed item that still has unchecked children (`--allow-open-children` to
override) — those are live work, and the archive is where nobody looks for it.
