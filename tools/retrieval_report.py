"""Per-doc read-frequency table from the PostToolUse retrieval log.

The log is written by the `Read|Grep|Glob` hook in `.claude/settings.json`
— one JSON line per tool call, with the path, the session id and a
timestamp. This turns it into a table: which docs a session actually opens, how
many distinct sessions opened each, and which were never opened.

⚠️ A doc with zero reads is a PRUNE CANDIDATE, not a verdict. Three things make a
zero honest-but-misleading: a doc read in a session that predates the hook, a doc
whose content reached the model through CLAUDE.md, and — the big one — **a doc
read through Bash.** The hook matches the `Read`, `Grep` and `Glob` TOOLS, so
`bash grep`, `sed`, `cat`, `head` and `python` reads are invisible to it.
The session that audited this instrument logged **4 reads while consulting
~14 docs**; `DECISIONS.md` and `AUDIT_LEDGER.md` were both read via Bash and
both scored zero. The undercount is not uniform — it falls hardest on the
big files a session greps rather than opens, which are the ones a prune would
target. The never-read list is where to look, not what to conclude.

⚠️ Read the DATE RANGE before the counts. Under ~2 weeks of normal sessions the
table settles nothing, and the report says so at the top rather than leaving the
reader to notice.

Usage::

    python tools/retrieval_report.py --all              # every path logged
